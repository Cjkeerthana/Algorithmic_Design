Algorithmic Design Homework 1: For the homework, generalization of Strassen and a memory efficient Strassen have been implemented.

Generalization of Strassen can be found in Strassen_Generalized

Memory efficient implementation can be found in Strassen_MemoryEfficient

The explanation of the idea behind both the algorithms can be found in the pdf HW1_MatrixMultiplication
